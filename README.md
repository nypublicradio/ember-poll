*A polling service for your ember apps*

Ember provides equivalents for `setTimeout`, but nothing for `setInterval`. This add-on offers a service you can use to manage intervals throughout your app.

One way that people will try to set up a poll in their Ember app is by calling a nested `run.later` based on some known timeout, like so:
```javascript
Ember.component.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(..arguments);
    this._poll(1000);
  },
  
  myPoller() {
    // do something on an interval
  },
  
  _poll(interval) {
    this.myPoller();
    
    Ember.run.later(() => this._poll(interval), interval);
  }
})
```

The problem with this is that any promise-waiters like `andThen` in your tests will never resolve, since each poll adds a new item to the runloop.

Instead, this service uses the native `setInterval` to start a poll, and also provides various methods to manage and track any it is given.

We can rely on the native `setInterval` function if the passed function is bound using `Ember.run.bind`, which ensures the given function is executed within an Ember runloop. This simplifies the the scheduling logic and allows us to maintain a single handler for every tick of the event loop.

## Installing

`npm install ember-poll --save-dev`

## Usage

Set up a poll anytime. Like maybe when a certain route is entered.
```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  poll: Ember.service.inject(),
  
  model() {
    return this.store.find('post');
  },
  
  actions: {
    didTransition() {
      let pollFunction = () => Ember.$.ajax('/api/ping');
      let pollId = this.get('poll').addPoll({
        interval: 60 * 1000, // one minute
        callback: pollFunction
      });
      
      this.set('pollId', pollId);
    },
    
    
    willTransition() {
      let pollId = this.get('pollId');
      this.get('poll').stopPoll(pollId);
    }
  }
  
});
```

Label polls for easier reference:
```javascript
this.get('poll').addPoll({
  interval: 60 * 1000,
  callback: callbackFn,
  label: 'server ping'
});

// later...
this.get('poll').stopPollByLabel('server ping');
```

Set up multiple polls and manage them all:
```javascript
this.get('poll').addPoll({
  interval: 60 * 1000,
  callback: () => Ember.$.ajax('/api/ping'),
  label: 'server ping'
});

let weatherPoll = this.get('poll').addPoll({
  interval: 60 * 1000 * 30,
  callback: otherCallback,
  label: 'weather update'
});

// and stop them all at once
this.get('poll').stopAll();

// restart a specific poll using its ID
this.get('poll').startPoll(weatherPoll);

// restart a specific poll using its label
this.get('poll').startPollByLabel('server ping');
```

## API
This service exposes for adding, stopping, and restarting polls.

* `addPoll({ interval, callback, [label] })`

`interval Number`

`callback Function`

`label String`

returns `pollId Number`

Adds a poll to the service and starts it *immediately*. Returns a unique id which can be used to reference the poll in other parts of the API.

* `startPoll( pollId )`

`pollId Number`

returns `pollId Number`

Starts a previously added poll and returns its *new* ID. *Note:* each time a polls is started, it is assigned a new id which must be tracked by the user for future reference.

* `startPollByLabel( pollLabel )`

`pollLabel String`

returns `pollId Number`

See `startPoll` for description. *Note:* a given poll's label is constant between starts and stops. This method will still return the polls updated ID.

* `stopPoll( pollId )`

`pollId Number`

returns `undefined`

Stops a previously added poll.

* `stopPollByLabel( pollLabel )`

`pollLabel String`

returns `undefined`

Stops a previously added poll.

* `stopAll()`

returns `undefined`

Stops all polls.

* `clearPoll( pollId )`

`pollId Number`

returns `undefined`

Removes a poll from the service's internal list of polls. If you are attempting to start and stop the same poll, this can be easier than tracking the returned handle. Polls will build up in the service's internal list as they are added, but they won't be removed when they are stopped. If the same poll is added on a recurring basis, it could cause a memory leak. Use `clearPoll` if the plan is to start and stop the same poll.

* `clearPollByLabel( pollLabel )`

`pollLabel String`

returns `undefined`

Clears a previously added poll looked up by its label.

* `clearAll()`

returns `undefined`

Clears all polls.
